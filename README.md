# Project Express API

The task was to create a small API with at least three different endpoints.

## The problem

I used a json-file about books. I created an endpoints to download the entire json-file of books. One endpoint to get the details about a single book (:bookID) and then an endpoint with books of a certain rating. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
